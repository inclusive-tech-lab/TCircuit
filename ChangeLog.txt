Working on the resistance concept
Created a Resistance scene and a Circiut scene
Resistance Scene: a micro view with a slider, changing the R value and sprite (changing number of ions)

1. change the haptic texture with the slider

2. make a fixed circuit in the Circuit scene, and transfer to the Resistance scene when tapped on the resistors.

1. work on the representation of the inside view

2. enable changing resistance of different components of the circuit.

2. Making only one object for the haptics instead of multiple objects.

I resolved the issue with button click() function and touch events by disabling standalone input module (script) from eventsystem.
Found solution from this link: https://answers.unity.com/questions/868618/problem-with-touch-and-raycast-and-ui-button.html
